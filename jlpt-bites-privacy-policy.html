Privacy Policy – JLPT Bites

Last updated: 27 November 2025

JLPT Bites (“the App”) is developed and operated by Suat Özkaya (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.

1. Information We Collect

JLPT Bites does not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII).

The App may process the following non-personal information locally on your device for the purpose of app functionality:

Your study progress (e.g., words completed, quiz scores)

App preferences (e.g., settings or saved data)

This data stays on your device and is never sent to any server.

2. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions

JLPT Bites offers optional in-app purchases or subscriptions through Google Play Billing.

When you make a purchase:

Payment information is processed only by Google Play

We do not receive or store your credit card details or personal payment information

Google may provide us with anonymous transactional data (e.g., purchase status)

3. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising SDKs.

If this changes in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

4. Children’s Privacy

JLPT Bites is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

5. Data Security

Because the App does not collect or store personal data, no data is transmitted over the internet.
All user progress is kept on the user’s personal device.

We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. Updates will be published on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
